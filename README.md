# RPN-Calc
Firmware of the hand-built RPN-Calculator

This software requires a decent microcontroller to run on.
I am using a Teensy 3.2, but a 3.0, 3.5, 3.6 or an Arduino Zero (compatible) CPU should work just fine.
For the screen, I recommend using a Nokia 5110 LCD. A 4x3 keypad is required. However, 4x4 should work fine too.
An optional status LED can be wired, but it is optional.
I will soon make the LiPo optional and add proper support for more hardware.
A schematic diagram will soon follow.
